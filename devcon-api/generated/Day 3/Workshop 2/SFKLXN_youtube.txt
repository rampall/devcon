Proponents of blockchains argue that compositionality is a key feature. What is compositionality though?  Maybe surprisingly, there is a rich mathematical framework in which the concept can be made precise as a theory of systems. In this workshop, we provide a primer of that theory and we showcase two practical applications based on it: compositionality in game theory (open games) and in formal verification (automata). The workshop is aimed at devs. There are no mathematical prerequisites.

Speaker(s): Fabrizio Romano Genovese, Philipp Zahn
Track: Cryptoeconomics
Keywords: Compositionality,Applied Category Theory,Open Games
