DeSci is the combination of open science principles and decentralization. This workshop aims to unite founders and developers in the DeSci ecosystem to explore what infrastructure is needed: from reputation systems for scientific credentials, to file storage, public good funding and financialisation. Participants will actively determine pressing needs and a roadmap to functioning DeSci dapps, while also exploring the cultural complexity and UX of scientists as a user group.
