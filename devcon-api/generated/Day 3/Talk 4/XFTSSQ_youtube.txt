Data has been useful in Web2 UX/UI design for quantifying user actions to understand what’s working and not working, but it doesn’t tell you why they’re doing that. When you pair participatory design with data design, you can get an effective picture of how and why people use the product. But, the problem is user research is becoming increasingly data heavy. Web3 enables more participatory design because people are aware of their data and are conscious of this type of exploitation.
