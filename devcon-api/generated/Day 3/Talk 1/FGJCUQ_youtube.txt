Governments have failed and evolved over thousands of years. But some web3 projects were built as though they’d get it right on the first try. That’s not realistic. And it’s not working. People don’t vote, the rules are complex, and protocols aren’t inclusive.

No one solution fixes all our problems but what we can do is build more adaptable governance systems. With a flexible, upgradeable, and modular foundation, governance systems can increase innovation & participation and decrease turmoil.
