Substreams is a powerful, parallelizable, blockchain data indexing technology, developed within The Graph.
It enables truly composable indexing, with shared modules written in Rust, both in batch and in streaming. It reaches unbeforeseen performances by virtue of its parallel design that supports both mappers and stateful store modules.
In this session, we will see how Substreams solve indexing for all blockchain protocols.
