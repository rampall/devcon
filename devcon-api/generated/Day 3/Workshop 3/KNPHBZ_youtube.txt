We all know there are not enough qualified people in the world to fill all the roles Web3 is asking for. We’ve got to *create* those people! Join our workshop to learn ways for developing good contributors.
We’ll start with an open office session where you can ask us your most burning questions. Then we’ll move into workstations where you can get 1on1 guidance on specific aspects of Web3 talent building. This means web2 to web3 conversion AND sharpening contributors who are already web3 native.

Speaker(s): Lenka Hudakova (Lenkla), Loie Taylor, Melanie Davis, Safder Raza
Track: Governance & Coordination
Keywords: Contributor Education,Performance,Web3 onboarding
