This session will be an unconventional panel discussion. Instead of being boring and repeating the same things, we will spice things up a bit.

The goal is to decide which is the best language for Ethereum.

How do we find that out? Though a combination of "pub quiz" and on-stage activity (e.g. tug-of-war) between members of different language teams. The audience can chime in as well.

Speaker(s): Hari, Leo Alt, Alex Beregszaszi
Track: Developer Infrastructure
Keywords: solidity,vyper,fe
