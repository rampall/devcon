Transactions executed on rollups have a different lifecycle to L1 transactions. In this hands-on workshop, for devs and users alike, we’ll use Arbitrum as a demonstration tool to send transactions, follow them through their different stages of finality and analyse what fees they pay.

Speaker(s): Chris Buckland
Track: Layer 2s
Keywords: rollups,transactions,gas
