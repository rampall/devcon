Non-transferable NFTs (or soul-bound tokens) open a rich design space for enhanced social coordination and ultimately decentralization within Ethereum. If you’re interested in building a bottom-up, decentralized future, we invite you to join us in exploring non-plutocratic DAO governance, community wallet recovery, and sybil-resistance as well as potential use cases in news, science, and the creative and knowledge economy to foster consensus across difference.

Speaker(s): Puja Ohlhaver, Paula Berman
Track: Opportunity & Global Impact
Keywords: DeSoc,Decentralization,Soulbound Tokens
