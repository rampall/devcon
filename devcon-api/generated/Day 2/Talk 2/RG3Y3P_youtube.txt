Many DAOs have adopted Oracle based tools to make gassless votes executable. I demonstrated an exploit of one such oracle that was possible because the other users on the oracle app were undercapitalized or not paying attention. This type of attack highlights the weaknesses and risks of many assumptions people have about the attention span of DAO members, and execution conditions. I will show common misconfigurations of tools that are the most risky, and show people how they can fix them.
