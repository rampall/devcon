We've got 25 minutes to go as deep as we can possibly go into the architecture of modern (modular) rollups. We'll be looking at the theory behind the components of these rollups and we'll be grounding this theory in the concrete components of the OP Stack.

Cmon, where do you think we are, 2019? It's 2022 y'all, and rollups are getting really, really cool.

This talk will cover a lot of technical detail in a short amount of time, so come prepared and chug a lot of coffee beforehand.
