Streameth is an open source video CMS that allows event organizers to distribute decentralized, censorship resistant video content.
This project comes out of a collaboration between Livepeer and Ethereum foundation to help web3 communities decouple themselves from centralized video platforms.

In this talk, we will explore why streameth was created, its early usage in various  community events and how we plan to evolve the tool.
