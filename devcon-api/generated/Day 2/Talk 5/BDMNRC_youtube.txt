Recursive zkSNARKs are poised to hit production in the next two years. We discuss how to think about the new affordances and potential applications that recursion unlocks for both scalability and privacy. These include proofs-of-proofs-of-knowledge like ETHdos, on-the-fly "programmable" SNARKs, incrementally verifiable computation, distributed proving, and tactics for reducing verification cost or proof size.

Speaker(s): Ying Tong, Nalin Bhardwaj
Skill level: Advanced
Track: ZKPs: Privacy, Identity, Infrastructure, & More
