MEV is inherent to Ethereum and cannot be banned at the core protocol layer. Dapps should therefore carefully assess and reduce the amount of MEV they create. Multi-dimensional batch auctions with just in time competition for order flow offer a fundamentally fairer way of trading on Ethereum. P2P matching reduces the amount of extractable AMM interactions, while best price execution is guaranteed through a network of competing “solvers”.
