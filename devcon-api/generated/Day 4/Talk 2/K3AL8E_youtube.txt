Eth EOAs and token standards (ERC20/721/1155) are terrible for end-user privacy. Can we build an alternative to them that preserves the existing functionalities while providing meaningful anonymity and privacy? This talk explores the functionality requirements of Eth user accounts, such as asset use authorization, asset & identity provenance, what privacy means in the areas of DeFi, NFTs, and identity, as well as concrete ways to build such an ecosystem.

Speaker(s): Wei Dai, Kyle Charbonnet
Skill level: Intermediate
Track: ZKPs: Privacy, Identity, Infrastructure, & More
