Historically, cryptographic protocols have been built special-purpose for specific kinds of claims or information hiding mechanisms. zkSNARKs and other new cryptographic tools move us to a world of "general-purpose" cryptography, where we have expressive languages to express claims about digital identity, reputation, and more. We discuss a high-level framework for thinking about where and why ZK and related technologies might (or might not) be useful for digital applications.
