Following a vast technology field with thousands of projects, protocols, tools, and frameworks is complex. Inspired by ThoughtWorks, we decided to map all these Web3 technologies, present them using a radar metaphor, and give them as a public good. This initiative helps developers understand ecosystems and technology stacks in the Web3 universe. It further allows them to create their radars. This talk will introduce this methodology framework to help tech teams make better decisions.

Speaker(s): Milos Novitovic, Uros Kukic
Track: Developer Infrastructure
