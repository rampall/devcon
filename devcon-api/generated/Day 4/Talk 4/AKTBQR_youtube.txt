I have always say and believe that art reflects what happens in society. 
From Renaissance to Cryptopunks, I am going to take you on a journey of the history of art, and why after the covid19 NFTs became popular, even though they were actually created in 2012 with the colored coins. Based on my own experience as the 1st female cryptoartist in Colombia, we will learn with what I like to call my"street" experience and discover the power of a female in a men dominated space.

Speaker(s): Soy Fira
Skill level: Beginner
Track: Opportunity & Global Impact
Keywords: NFTs,Female Empowerment and History of Art
