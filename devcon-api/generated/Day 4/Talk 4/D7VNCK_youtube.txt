Crypto wallet is an entry point to onboard users to Web3, but the complexity of key management prevents the real decentralization to be realized and widely adopted. After the Merge, Ethereum is pivoting to a rollup-centric roadmap. What does the future wallet look like? In this talk, I would like to talk about what is the missing part for current wallet design centered around L2, DeFi applications, abstract account and social recovery from our past experience.
