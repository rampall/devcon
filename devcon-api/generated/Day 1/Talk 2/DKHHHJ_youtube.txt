We shill an assembly SHA256 library that is optimized to compute the hash tree root of a Merkle tree. It consists of reusing two publicly available methods:
1. Hardcoding padding block. This method is used in Bitcoin's core client hashing algo. 
2. Use CPU-vectorization to hash different branches in parallell. This is Intel's "multi-buffer" method. 

Initial benchmarks show up to 1200% improvement on hashing of large lists on AVX512. 

A GoAssembly version is used by prysm.
