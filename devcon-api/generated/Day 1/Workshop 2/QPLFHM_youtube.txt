In this workshop we will show participants how to setup and run the [beaconcha.in-explorer](https://beaconcha.in) for existing networks (mainnet, prater, sepolia) as well as for custom networks. Also we will explain how to analyze the network using the explorer and how to monitor validators. By doing this workshop we hope to learn about problems people are running into while trying to run the explorer on their own and improve the usabilty of the explorer in general.

Speaker(s): Patrick Pfeiffer, Stefan Starflinger
Track: Staking & Validator Experience
Keywords: explorer,validators,staking
