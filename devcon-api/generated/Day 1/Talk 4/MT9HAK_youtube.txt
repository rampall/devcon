(1) Multi-VM Support: AltLayer enables Ethereum with on-demand EVM/WASM execution layer.
(2) Elastic Scalability: To handle surge requests on Ethereum, AltLayer enables dApps to quickly spin off custom execution layer (flash layers) to serve users, with near-instant finality(<2s), low gas fees (<0.01USD) and high throughput(~2,000 tps). 
(3) Ubiquitous Verification: To embrace decentralization, AltLayer runs multiple block producers/verifiers including commodity machines, browsers for users.
