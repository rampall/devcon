Two of the biggest arguments against L2s are that they are breaking composability and interoperability. DApps are deployed as stand-alone apps in each L2 with limited ability to communicate with each other. This leads to silos and several issues in terms of capital efficiency, governance, security, user experience and maintenance.
We will explore how bridges should become the interoperability layer that will connect all the protocol “silos” across L2s, by using secure message passing.

Speaker(s): Georgios Gontikas
Track: Layer 2s
