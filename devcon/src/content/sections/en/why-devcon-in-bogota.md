title: Why Devcon in Bogota?

  Our search for a fitting location for Devcon VI began prior to Devcon V in 2019. After exploring venues in over ten cities across the world, and meticulously evaluating each against an extensive set of criteria, the clear winner was Bogotá, Colombia.


  In Bogotá we found the seeds for an ambitious community that our ecosystem could help grow. From builders, to educational entities, local business and industry leaders and more, we’re excited to meet and to work with those making real-world use of Ethereum’s technology locally, and to further those efforts.

  In addition to the potential to grow a community, the venue is located just minutes from hotels, and from both Bogota’s El Dorado International Airport, and close to some of the nicest areas in Bogotá such as Chapinero Alto, La Candelaria, Parkway & Zona G among others. The fully modern conference center is built to handle everything Devcon requires, from catering, to wifi, meeting-space and more.


  Thanks to its location in the northern part of South America, Bogotá is also one of the most accessible cities in South America. With its major international airport offering direct flights from many regions around the world, Bogotá is a gateway to the rest of beautiful Latin America. 


  This process has been long and somewhat delicate given the complicated past few years that we’ve all had, but we are excited to finally host Devcon VI in Bogotá.
