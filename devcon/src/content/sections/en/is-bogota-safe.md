  Colombia is safer today than at any point in the last 50 years, and we expect
  Devcon in Bogotá to be an impactful experience for all. That said, while
  Bogotá is a very modern city, it is located in a developing country, and **we
  recommend exercising some basic precautions.** Do that, and your biggest problem
  will likely be wanting to stay longer.


  Historic and popular areas, all of which are generally in the center and north of the center, are the safest regions. We’ll also help to guide attendees toward the right spots at the right time of day, for example: trendy areas that are ripe with nightlife are better after dark, while the historic center is best to frequent during daylight hours.

  The local expression in Bogotá is: “No des papaya,” or “Don’t give a papaya.”
  It essentially means, don’t make yourself an obvious target: use common sense
  while in Bogotá. That means:


  * **Look where you’re going**

  * **Don’t wear flashy items like expensive watches or gold-plated hardware wallets**

  * **Don’t walk around with your phone out or with your laptop when not necessary**

  * **Leave valuables (passport, excess cash/cards) in your hotel**

  * **Avoid hailing street taxis. Use Uber or DiDi, where a 20-min ride costs around $3 USD. Tip: maybe pay the extra dollar for a nicer “Uber Comfort” *(recommended when coming from the Airport)***

  * **Try not to walk home alone at night (Reminder: Ubers are easy & cheap)**


  You can choose your adventure, and with a little bit of common sense and extra precaution, you can expect to have a fun and safe experience in Bogotá.
