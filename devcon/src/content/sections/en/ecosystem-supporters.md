This year, aligned teams will have the opportunity to contribute toward Ethereum-related public goods in a Devcon-specific effort to grow the Ethereum ecosystem, and further technologies that help us move forward together. In lieu of a traditional sponsorship program, team-based ticket allocations will be distributed to participating groups as a thank you to those who give back to the Ethereum community.
