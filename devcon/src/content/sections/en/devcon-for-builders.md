Devcon always had a heavy technical focus to it, and this will remain true this year and into the future (itâ€™s the DEVelopers CONference after all!). Though Ethereum is a technological breakthrough in its own right, its applications reach much further, into digital economy, research, community, art, and beyond.

**Devcon is not _only_ for developers**, it is for builders of all kinds: engineers, designers, researchers, infrastructure operators, community organizers, social economists, artists, and more. So we want to invite everyone who is looking to build and create to improve our existing world using Ethereum and decentralized systems.
