title: Community and Ecosystem Hubs at Devcon BogotÃ¡!
left: >-
  ### Community Hubs are the dedicated space at the Devcon venue from the
  community for the community. 

  By enabling a handful of communities to create and display content of their choice we pave the way for a more decentralized Devcon.


  This year, we invited communities, initiatives, interest groups and collectives to apply for their chance to get one of the available hub areas. The selected organizing groups are solely responsible for the space and what happens in it throughout the course of the whole conference.

  ## Guidelines


  All of the community hubs must follow certain guidelines, but above all they should be:


  * Marketing-free â€” no shilling! 

  * Content first.

  * No bull ðŸ’©.

  * Tech-focused / community-focused.

  * Must offer a benefit for the audience.

  * Accessible to all Devcon attendees.

  * Dedicated to specific cause or topic.
