  ### ETHMedellin ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ â€”Â October 18-22 


  A short flight or bus-ride away lies Medellin, BogotÃ¡â€™s warmer and more touristic neighbor. A great excuse to extend your trip or travel with some newfound friends to unite with the Ethereum Medellin community for a week of open co-working, evening events, NFT activations, and conferences.

  ### ETHPanama ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ â€”Â October 26-28


  Just one week after ETHMedellin and a cheap one-hour flight, ETHPanama will be taking place in Panama City. Join for some continued learning, exposure to the Panamanian Ethereum community, and there just might be group surf trip afterwards for the more adventurous of the group!
