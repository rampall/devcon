Satellite events should take place during 

Devcon Week: 7-16 October 2022.


All satellite events are self-organized and totally independent from Devcon.

This idea is a result of a [Devcon Improvement Proposal](https://forum.devcon.org/t/dip-devcon-satellites/91) submitted by community member [abcoathup](https://twitter.com/abcoathup). ðŸ¦„
