  - Chapinero (30-minute Uber to the venue)
  
    _Highly recommended, particularly the area above “Carrera 15” and between “Calles 53 and 100”._

    Upmarket Chapinero features a mix of mountainside residential sections and commercial zones with glitzy malls and different hotel options. Fine-dining areas like Parque de la 93, Zona T and Zona G buzz in the evening, as do the glamorous clubs and bars of Zona Rosa. It covers some nice neighborhoods such as Quinta Camacho, Chapinero Alto, El Nogal, Chico and Rosales among others. [View on Google Maps](https://bit.ly/3PZItWY)

  - La Soledad (15-minute Uber to the venue)

    Known for its 1940s British-style houses and bohemian vibe, La Soledad is a relaxed residential district that also offers a wide range of restaurants, small bars, and cafes. Playhouses include La Casa del Teatro Nacional, which co-hosts the biennial Bogotá Ibero-American Theater Festival, and the strikingly modern Casa E.
