title: Continuous.... What?
left: "### Continuous Devcon brings together a variety of opportunities for the
  community to get hands-on involved and shape the event. Furthermore, parts of
  the amazing venue will be accessible into the evening hours, enabling
  participants to continue exchanging ideas even after the main program has
  concluded for the day, **turning Devcon into a truly continuous and more
  holistic and collaboration-focused experience.**"

  The venue and space is open, available, and welcoming until 11pm — much later than you might be used to from other Devcons. This means you can smoothly transition into the evening and have more time to explore the initiatives besides the main program!


  The venue fosters collaboration, networking, exchange, creativity, creation, experimentation and relaxation through various spaces dedicated especially to that.


  Make sure to check out the Community Hubs area and the Devcon after Dark program.
