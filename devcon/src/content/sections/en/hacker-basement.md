title: Hacker Basement
---
Looking for a place where you can code and learn? We got you covered!

The hacker basement is your high-focus zone away from the busy conference ado.

It sets the right conditions for an individual to test new stuff on their laptop, to learn, or to hack on new ideas in a group.

Everything a hacker needs will be taken care of: cozy seating, electricity, internet and, of course, cyberpunk lighting and low-fi beats to get you in the right mood to build!

The hacker basement comes with a gaming area as well, which will be used for gaming sessions, meetups and more! Check out the [Devcon after Dark program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/180O59H2I0Fr_m8pQwoom7Ux5Il9OlJte6n53CGXva40/edit#gid=0) to not miss anything.
