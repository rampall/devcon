1. Timeline

   - Applications open June 6
   - Deadline to Apply July 5
   - All decisions will be sent before the end of July, and as quickly as possible
   - _NOTE: We want everyone to be able to plan affordable travel if they want to attend Devcon. Opening applications early in the summer allows applicants ample time to prepare their applications, reviewers time to carefully review each application, and applicants to know many months in advance whether or not their application has been accepted._

1. Review Process

   - Each track has its own reviewing committee, consisting of a team lead & a diverse set of reviewers.
   - Each application will be reviewed by multiple members of the review team. All reviewers’ scores are weighted equally.
   - Talks will be selected on aggregate scores from the criteria below

   Criteria

   - Each reviewer will be asked to review each application using the following prompts:
     - Is the submission information accurate?
       - Is the submission in the right track and category? See above for more info on Tracks & Categories.
     - Is the submission focused on sharing knowledge?
       - All submissions must have the intended purpose of sharing knowledge (experience, learnings, development, research, or a specific problem they are hoping to solve.)
       - NOTE: Reviewers will not accept an application that is devoted to promoting a company or project. If you would like to shill a project this is not the place.
     - Is the submission innovative and/or novel?
       - All talks and submissions should be geared to present new ideas to drive the ecosystem forward, not repeat presentations that have been given several times before.
     - Is the submission constructive?
       - Does the submission aim to solve a problem or contribute to the ecosystem in some way? Is it providing insight or solutions to a challenge faced by many?
     - Is the speaker qualified?
       - Does the speaker have sufficient knowledge and experience to present on this topic?
       - NOTE: Prior speaking experience is _not_ required, but domain-specific knowledge is. Your application will have multiple opportunities for you to demonstrate your understanding of the topic that you on which you would like to present.

1. Decision

   - The speaker application process is VERY competitive and unfortunately, this may mean that quality talks are not selected due to time and space constraints.
   - You will be notified of the status of your application before the end of July. Reviewers’ decisions are final, and there is no repeal process, but(!) there are lots of ways to contribute to Devcon if your application is not accepted.

1. Other ways to contribute
   - Host an impromptu workshop or talk by booking one of them in one of the bookable workshop rooms or in the Hacker Space
   - Volunteer and help make this Devcon VI the best Devcon ever!
   - Apply for a Builder Ticket
   - Share your ideas on the [Devcon Forum](https://forum.devcon.org/) to collaborate with other attendees
