description: "I am a student of the University of Twente in the Netherlands who has studied Applied Physics and Master's Computer Science. I recently completed my thesis on the topic of decentralised staking pools. I applied for a grant from the Ethereum Foundation to continue this research, but ultimately withdrew the application due to the variability of the \"Shasper\" proposal. I am involved in the Eth-2.0 bi-weekly calls and have been and will be attending the sharding events. I am currently working on building a Vyper BLS12-381 Library."
