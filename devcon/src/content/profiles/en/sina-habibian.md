description: "I was formerly the engineering lead at Truebit, a protocol for verifiable offchain computation for scalability on Ethereum. I developed the first implementation (link below), wrote our WebAssembly virtual machine spec (link below). I also helped launch ETHPrize (ethprize.io) to help pinpoint open problems in the Ethereum ecosystem and fund resources towards them. I have presented on scalability at numerous conferences – EthDenver, the San Francisco and Silicon Valley Ethereum Meetups, Ethcc, amongst others (links below).
