Devcon is an intensive introduction for new Ethereum explorers, a global family reunion for those already a part of our ecosystem, and a source of energy and creativity for all.

We host Devcon to educate and empower the community to build and use decentralized systems. It is a conference for builders of all kinds. 

Our goal is to push the boundaries of possibility in our mission to bring decentralized protocols, tools, and culture to the world. Programming covers content ranging from the deeply technical to the profoundly human.
