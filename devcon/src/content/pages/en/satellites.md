Devcon Satellite Events are an experiment to decentralize Devcon VI, to give the opportunity to foster a community amongst those who can’t make it to Bogotá due to distance, timing, costs, limited space, or other constraints, and to boost local Ethereum communities. 🌍

Devcon Satellite Events can be just a simple get-together of friends watching the live streams with pizza or bigger meetups to rewatch the keynote talks at a time that’s better suited for your community. 🍕
