        {' '}
        Harassment includes, but is not limited to, any threatening, abusive, or insulting words, behavior, or
        communication (whether in person or online), whether relating to gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental

        Harassment also includes hacking, deliberate intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact, and

        This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating at Devcon - from attendees and exhibitors to speakers,
        press, volunteers, etc.

      <p className="font-lg text-underline bold">Be Respectful to Speakers (and audiences)</p>

        Be mindful of your volume when you&apos;re in or near event venues. Noise levels can quickly get out of control

        arriving late to an event and/or getting up to leave an event early â€” try to cause as little disruption as
        possible.

      <p>
        4.3 False certification, misuse of a Wristband, or any other method or device used to assist unauthorized
        personnel to gain admittance to Devcon will be just cause for: (a) denying entry to and expelling You and any
        other persons involved from Devcon without any obligation on Our part to refund any fees; and (b) banning You
        and any other persons involved from present and future events.

        also exclude any person from purchasing a ticket. We also reserve the right to cancel, at Our sole discretion,

        fees will be deducted from the refund amount.
      </p>

      <p>
        7.3 Please remember that cancelling Your ticket or sponsorship does not automatically cancel Your hotel and
        travel arrangements. You are responsible for Your own hotel and travel plans including, but not limited to, all
        costs, expenses, and fees associated with the cancellation.

      <p>
        We shall not be held responsible for any delay or failure in the performance of Our obligations under this
        Agreement to the extent that such delay or failure is caused by fire, flood, earthquakes, strike, civil,
        governmental, or military authority, acts of God, acts of terrorism, acts of war, disease, epidemics or
        pandemics, blackouts, insurrections, riots, civil disturbances, electrical disruptions, third-party injunctions,
        the unavailability of all or part of the venue, or other similar causes beyond Our reasonable control and
        without the fault of Us or Our subcontractors. For one or more of such reasons, We may postpone, reschedule, or
        cancel any part of or the entirety of Devcon without liability on Our part. In the event any part of or the
        entirety of Devcon cannot be held or is postponed pursuant to this section, We shall not be liable to You for
        any incidental, consequential, special, direct, or indirect damages, costs, or losses incurred, including, but

        provided at Devcon. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of warranties or limitations on the duration of
        implied warranties, so the above disclaimer may not apply to You in their entirety, but will apply to the
        maximum extent permitted by the applicable law.
