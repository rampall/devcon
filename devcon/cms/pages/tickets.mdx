      All proceeds from the Auction above the reserve price will be used to help
      people attend Devcon through funding programs like the **[EF Next Billion
      Scholars program](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/07/devcon7-scholars)**
      and other Devcon initiatives. If you bid above the reserve price but do
      not win in the auction, you will automatically be funneled into the Raffle
      for a ticket. If you win the Raffle, you will be able to withdraw all
      funds above the Reserve price. If you do not win in either the Raffle or
      Auction, you will be able to withdraw all of your funds. Like last time,
      one lucky winner will receive a free Golden Ticket to Devcon & will be
      able to withdraw all of their funds.
