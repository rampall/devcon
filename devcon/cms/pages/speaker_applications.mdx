decision:
  title: Decision
  body: >
    The speaker application process is very competitive and unfortunately, this
    may mean that quality talks are not selected due to time and space
    constraints.


    • By the end of August, first decisions will be made.

    Expect all decisions to be final by the end of September.


    • You will be notified of the status of your application once all
    applications have been carefully reviewed by our committee of experts.


    • Reviewers’ decisions are final, and there is no appeal process, but there
    are lots of ways to contribute to Devcon if your application is not
    accepted.


    • **All accepted speakers hosting talks, workshops, or panels will receive a
    ticket to attend Devcon**. If you already purchased a ticket by the time you
    receive your confirmation, you will be able to get a refund.

    Lightning Talk speakers will be able to purchase a discounted ticket.
