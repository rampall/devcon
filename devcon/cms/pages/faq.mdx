  - question: Devcon is NOT looking for partnerships
    answer: >
      We ♥️ dogfooding Ethereum tech! If you are building something that aligns
      with Ethereum values (decentralization, open-source, neutrality), is not
      commercial, and can enrich the Devcon experience for all attendees, share
      your ideas on the Forum, and make a proposal on how to improve Devcon!

  - question: What is the difference between Devcon and Devconnect?
    answer: "Devcon and Devconnect are the only two events organized by the Ethereum Foundation (yes, all the other amazing ETH events are community-run!). Both events are Ethereum-focused but serve different purposes.\n\nDevcon\_is a global Ethereum family reunion, a place to celebrate success and align on updates and direction. It is our principal event, all in one place with one big venue, and talks and workshops open to all.\_[Devcon SEA will take place in Bangkok, Thailand between 12-15 November 2024!\_](https://devcon.org/)\n\n[Devconnect]()\_on the other hand, is a week to make progress, dive deep into specific topics among fellow experts, to co-work and collaborate. It is structurally entirely different from Devcon, and consists of many individual events, organized by you the community, that each cover one topic in depth.\n"
