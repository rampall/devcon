  ## **See you in Bangkok!**


  ### **Devcon is a non-profit event about **the future of technology,
  computing, and society, and it's coming to** Bangkok, Thailand!**


  Southeast Asia has many strong grassroots Ethereum communities and activities
  around technology, crypto, and using Ethereum for social good.


  Bangkok, the capital and most populous city of Thailand is a great place to
  welcome our global Ethereum community, with low visa restrictions and great
  accessibility.


  **Devcon SEA will take place between 12-15 November at the QSNCC.**

      ### We are bringing the Ethereum community to a place with striking contrasts; Ornate ancient temples like Wat Arun and Wat Phra Kaew coexist with ultramodern skyscrapers.

      ###### Bangkok's cuisine is world-famous, with street food, pad Thai, mango sticky rice, spicy tom yum soup, and more. The city’s green spaces, such as Lumphini Park, Bang Krachao the “green lung” of Bangkok, and Benchakitti Park directly next to the Devcon venue, offer an escape from the urban hustle.
      
      ###### Bangkok lies in the heart of the Chao Phraya River delta and has an intricate canal network, often referred to as the "Venice of the East". The river serves as a vital transportation route in Bangkok, with public water buses, cross-river ferries, and tourist boats as popular modes of transport. These boats offer great views of the palaces and temples along the river.

  ## **Why Devcon Southeast Asia?**


  ### We call it Devcon Southeast Asia because the entire region deserves this
  significant Ethereum community event coming to their country. Ethereum
  communities in SEA are very active and many want to see Ethereum succeed.
  Ethereum has real use cases in SEA, with high crypto adoption in Vietnam, the
  Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand.


  Bangkok was selected for its low visa restrictions, excellent connectivity via
  Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) and Don Mueang International Airport (DMK), and
  abundance of hotels and side event spaces. The QSNCC is a huge, modern venue
  that has recently been renovated and is equipped to meet all of Devcon’s
  needs.

This year, it will be celebrated on **November 15th**, the last day of Devcon!\_\n\nThe festival involves floating decorated baskets (krathongs) on water to honor the river goddess Phra Mae Khongkha, symbolizing the letting go of negativity and making wishes for the future. In Bangkok, there are several popular places close to water to participate in Loy Krathong. One notable location is Benjakiti Park, conveniently located next to QSNCC, the Devcon venue!\n\n<Buttons\n  Button={[\n    { text: \"Tourism Thailand Website\", url: \"\", color: \"orange-1\", fill: false }\n  ]}\n/>\n"

  ## **Getting Around**

  <TwoColumns
    left={<>
      ### Bangkok’s traffic can get busy with many motorcycles on the roads. The public transport system of the BTS Skytrain and MRT is crucial to avoid traffic congestion and runs from early morning to midnight with high frequency. The Devcon venue is directly connected to the MRT stop “Queen Sirikit National Convention Center”.
    </>}
    right={<>
      You can conveniently use your Visa or Mastercard contactless credit card to tap in and out of MRT lines, whereas the BTS Skytrain requires cash for both single-journey tickets and refillable cards.
      
      ###### If you need a ride, the ride-sharing app [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/) is widely used and also offers food and grocery delivery.
