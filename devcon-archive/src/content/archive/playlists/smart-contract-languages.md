title: The Emergence of Smart Contract Languages
description: Smart contract languages can be described as the special purpose tools that make creating unstoppable applications on Ethereum possible. Developing such a language while the entire ecosystem around it is still evolving poses interesting challenges. Over the years, several smart contract languages for EVM-compatible blockchains have been prototyped and developed. Some achieved adoption while others stayed in the experimental stage or were mere thought experiments. Follow us on a journey through smart contract language history at Devcon!
