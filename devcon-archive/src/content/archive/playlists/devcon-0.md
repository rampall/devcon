title: Devcon 0
description: 'It all began in Berlin. Long prior to the launch of Ethereum, the earliest builders and co-founders gathered in the Kreuzberg neighborhood in late November of 2014 to outline their work and designs for the future of Ethereum at a meetup called "ÐΞVcon-0". A great resource to learn about the historical context and the early ethos of the project.'
