title: Design to learn
description: 'Design for web3 products and services is hard. 

Creating intuitive and USEFUL products requires balancing both the complexities of entirely new design paradigms with the newfound utility that cryptocurrency and web3 technologies enable. 

Designing for eco-systems looks a lot more like designing for living things. Design is no longer a discrete function of production and delivery, but a continuous strategic activity of any product or service operating in this new reality. When things get more intelligent, value of design shifts to learning, what is our speed to learning, and how we can change what needs to change. We need to design for what we can learn to ultimately discover the evovling needs for information participants more effectively.'
