title: "How can the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance interoperate with the public Ethereum chain EIP process?"
description: "Members of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and the Ethereum core Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process will have a facilitated breakout session discussion on how to interoperate, learn from each other. The EIP processÂ builds on large scale public open source collaboration, also inspired for historical reasons by the Bitcoin BIP process. Which in turn borrows from Python PEPs, XMPP XEPs, and so on. The EEA has a more formal technical steering committee process for its corporate members.
The goal is to improve the quality of the technical Ethereum ecosystem overall, and understand how private chain, enterprise use cases can interoperate with public chain EIP processes."
